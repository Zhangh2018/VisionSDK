**************************
ACF 'offline' build
**************************
Open a command line in the root folder and issue the command 'mingw32-make acfoffline'.

This will invoke the autobuld on all relevant ACF graphs/processes required by the higher level
applications/examples.

Note: if "cgv_all_build" has already been compiled as described in "BuildInstructions.txt",
this step can be skipped.

**************************		
INTEGRITY build with MULTI
**************************

It is assumed that Green Hills Integrity and Green Hills Multi are already installed and the user has a basic
working knowledge of the Multi IDE.

- Tested with the following tool versions:
  * integrity 11.0.4
  * multi 6.1.4

****************************************
OPENCL EXAMPLE MULTI BUILD and EXECUTION
****************************************
OpenCL example project is included as part of /multi/TopLevel.gpj.
Open this top level project and compile.

The following dynamic downloadable project is available and can be loaded
and executed:
ddl_apuocl.gpj       -> OpenCL example project

Note that for ACF native kernel support, ACF 'offline" build is required first.

**************************************************
OPENCL CONFORMANCE MULTI MULTI BUILD and EXECUTION
**************************************************
1. Extract OpenCL conformance Loads:

Extract this package "integer_ops_cloud_1.8.1.zip" into:
\ICP_SDK\src\Features\ICP\ACL\APEX2\src\integer_ops

2. Project:

Open the top level project /multi/OpenCL_conformanceRelease.gpj and compile.  
The following dynamic downloads are available and can be loaded
and executed:

dd_integerOps.gpj       -> OpenCL conformance integer operation test suite

3. Conformance Test Selection:
Please refer to "\Applications\Cognivue\OpenCL_Conformance\ConformanceGlobals.h" to switch between two test modes;
